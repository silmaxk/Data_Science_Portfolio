# Data Science Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! Here you will be able to see repositories containing Data Science projects I have completed either for academic, self-learning, or "just because" purposes.  You will be able to see my projects using Google Colab as well as Jupyter Notebook presented in file formats. 

While still being an aspiring Data Scientist (undergraduate student), I will be uploading my practice and projects in this Repository in hopes of maintaining my projects and for future references when needed. 

I utilize open data sources to conduct my studies and practice as well as available data sources provided to me by professors or from personal data collection. 

Thank you for reading!
